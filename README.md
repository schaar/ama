# matt's AMA.

In the spirit of [Zach Holman's](http://zachholman.com) wildly successful AMA, I've decided to do the same. I figure this is a lot easier than trying to monitor some kind of Disqus forum, and since I've been working at GitHub, this should suit us fine.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/moby/ama/issues/new) on this
project. You can also add a tag to it depending on the category (I've created some general ones already, so if it doesn't fit into one of those, just leave it blank.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/moby/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter to see what I've answered before. You can also filter by tab/category if you'd like.

### Twitter

If you'd rather just inquire about something in shortform, I'm [@mattschaar](https://twitter.com/mattschaar) on
Twitter.
